Yesterday my root user account, lovemeknot285@gmail.com, was locked when I failed to log into it via the console.  Today I updated the password and can fully log in, however, I cannot access certain functions with the error: "you do not have sufficient permission. access denied".  I think there is some unlocking that still needs to happen to my root user.  Can you please clear all limits on the account?   Thanks.
