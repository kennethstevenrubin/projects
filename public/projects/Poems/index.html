        <h1>The Voyager</h1>
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;Relief does not exist throughout eternity,<br />
        &nbsp;Eternity's grounds are for reality to decree,<br />
        &nbsp;Yet there are those who would have no bounds,<br />
        &nbsp;And their capsules set them free.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;Be.  Yet head for the heavenly--<br />
        &nbsp;Though Earth-bound eventually.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;In the altered state, listen!<br />
        &nbsp;For the fantastic appear,<br />
        &nbsp;And the invisible are here.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;Yet in the suffering of those who wake,<br />
        &nbsp;Reality is all that's left,<br />
        &nbsp;To the the voyager...and the man,<br />
        &nbsp;And the man's mind...bereft!<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Heart</h1>
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;usually it happens after a brief summer rain...<br />
        &nbsp;in the morning they arrive, with the<br />
        &nbsp;dew and fog<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;it's the heavy odor of life that stirs them, for<br />
        &nbsp;the air is thick and rich with green<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;always they move among the trees and bushes,<br />
        &nbsp;darting into the dark and cover<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;that is not to say the fields are bare!  for<br />
        &nbsp;they go there too, to skip and scatter like hares<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;yes, you have seen them -- though perhaps not<br />
        &nbsp;for what they were<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;they have been about since the fields were<br />
        &nbsp;new, and the forests drank in mystery<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;for their ways are the old ways<br />
        &nbsp;the ways of earth and mud and stone<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;and we are but passengers to them<br />
        &nbsp;always awake and always alone<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;so go slow, speak to trees, take long<br />
        &nbsp;forgotten walks; and they will be with you<br />
        &nbsp;to keep you young at heart<br />
        &nbsp;<br />

        <h1>I Love Wind</h1>
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;I love wind<br />
        &nbsp;It ripples water<br />
        &nbsp;Trees sway to it<br />
        &nbsp;It carries their leaves<br />
        &nbsp;And I don't mind a little cold--<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it reminds me I'm still alive<br />
        &nbsp;<br />

        <h1>Cycle</h1>
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;Even here the brave majesty of earth can be felt.<br />
        &nbsp;Life strives up through myth and man.<br />
        &nbsp;The weak are destroyed.<br />
        &nbsp;The strong survive.<br />
        &nbsp;This is the way.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;Yet stronger still, evolution strives against entropy.<br />
        &nbsp;For always with breakdown there is again rebirth.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;<br />

        <h1>What It Is To Be Alive</h1>
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;I feel at one with with world this morning.<br />
        &nbsp;As people race and struggle to get to work, <br />
        &nbsp;I don't feel this as the separation of ego but rather<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the community of beings being alive--<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the breath of the universe surges through us all.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;What we want is what all beings want.<br />
        &nbsp;What we know, all beings know.<br />
        &nbsp;It is the never-ending striving<br />
        &nbsp;The seed reaching up through soil<br />
        &nbsp;The solitary bird embracing sky.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;For there is no separation.<br />
        &nbsp;Incarnation itself brings us together<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that we might spark and diminish<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that we might feel what it is to be alive.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />

        &nbsp;Buddhism is<br/>
        &nbsp;what it needs<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;This is mind<br />

        &nbsp;Sit is mind<br />

        &nbsp;That is<br />
        &nbsp;<br />

        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;Life grapples,<br />
        &nbsp;My mind grapples.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;I don’t play the numbers any more,<br />
        &nbsp;I can’t remember them.<br />

        &nbsp;I feel into my body<br />
        &nbsp;My pain lights my way<br />
        &nbsp;Though someone wise<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;once led me astray<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;It passes through<br />
        &nbsp;It passes away<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;I felt into your body<br />
        &nbsp;I took it all that day<br />
        &nbsp;I reached down into darkness<br />
        &nbsp;You had nothing to say<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;It passes by<br />
        &nbsp;It passes away<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;So sit here my friend, sit just next to me<br />
        &nbsp;And pour two pints of bitter brew<br />
        &nbsp;For we have plans to make we two<br />

        &nbsp;Abject and true<br />
        &nbsp;It fills me<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I talk with you.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;How long before you know<br />
        &nbsp;I'm not the one you knew?<br />

        &nbsp;I don't know the rules, you see<br />
        &nbsp;I never learned the game.<br />

        &nbsp;It's OK though,<br />

        &nbsp;It's a learned response<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;The signals crossed<br />
        &nbsp;And now I'm lost<br />
